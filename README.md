## Project Title: Lovely? Danger? Dogs in NYC!
Term: Fall 2019

+ **Project summary**: Dog has been an important partner for many people’s daily life. Dogs are so beloved that owners often consider them as their own children and name them according to their unique personalities. According to the New York City Economic Development Corporation, there are around 600,000 dogs in NYC. Therefore, in this project, we are interested to look deeper into the dog population in NYC. The target users for our shiny app are pet retailers, dog lovers, and non-dog lovers. More specifically, for a pet retailer opening a new store in NYC, they may interest to see the dog density in each area of the city and find the store locations which are surrounded by numerous of dog owners. In addition, by looking at the dog breed distribution in the associated area, a local pet retailer could decide its store inventories to meet the needs of the popular dog breed in its regions. On the other hand, for the individual user, if you are a dog lover that recently move to New York, you may want to move to a dog-friendly neighborhood so that it will suit for you and your dog, and the dog density information on our app can help you on such decisions. For non-dog lovers, you may try to avoid walking in dog-dense areas. Also, our danger zone provides information for non-dog lovers about dog bite incidents information for each area and the associated dog bite statistic by breed. Non-dog lovers may also want to pay attention to those danger areas and dangerous breeds.
